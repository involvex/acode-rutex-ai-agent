# 🤖 Rutex: The Autonomous AI Agent for Acode

## 🚀 Bringing Desktop-Class Automation to Android

Rutex is a high-performance, autonomous AI agent plugin built specifically for the Acode mobile editor. It transforms Acode from a simple text editor into a fully agentic IDE, allowing LLMs to perceive, analyze, and manipulate your codebase in real-time.

### 🛠️ Core Capabilities

- **📁 File System Mastery**: Direct ability to read, create, edit, rename, and delete files and directories.
- **⚙️ Agentic Loop**: Executes tasks in a chain (Read → Analyze → Edit → Verify) without requiring constant user prompts.
- **💻 Terminal Integration**: Bridges the gap between the editor and the shell for seamless build and deployment workflows.
- **⚡ Context-Aware**: Maintains deep project context to handle complex refactoring and multi-file updates.

### 🔌 Supported Providers

Rutex currently supports the following AI providers, with more coming soon:

- **Gemini**: High-performance multimodal capabilities.
- **OpenRouter**: Access to a vast array of top-tier LLMs.
- **Ollama**: Local LLM execution. (_Note: Connecting directly to ollama.com may cause CORS issues; please use a CORS-proxy URL that redirects to your Ollama instance_).
- **OpenAI**: Industry-leading models including GPT-4 and GPT-3.5.

- **📝 Intelligent Diff Engine**: Instead of overwriting files, Rutex uses a precise line-based edit system. It calculates line shifts in real-time to perform surgical updates, ensuring no accidental data loss and maximizing token efficiency.

Built with **TypeScript** and **Webpack**, Rutex utilizes a secure tool-calling protocol to interact with the Acode API, ensuring that every file modification is precise and traceable.
